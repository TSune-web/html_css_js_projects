Mainly to practise Axios

1.Write the form settings
    -> addEventListener => submit event
    -> e.preventDefault()
    -> test if it works as expected

2.Extract values from the form
3.Create a query string oject 
    -> which is a value of the property params
4.Use axios to connect w/ the url with a query string oject
    -> use await

5.create a function to display images
    -> loop over an array of data
    -> check if the targetted data is available
        -> if not, do nothing
    -> create a new element
    -> fetch that data from the form
    -> append the data to HTML tag/ body element
